# Terse — The AI Agent Butler

**One companion for every AI coding agent you run.**

Live-monitor your agents, cap runaway spend *before* the next API call, keep your MCP setup clean, and compress every prompt 40–70%. All on-device.

## What is Terse?

**Terse is an on-device AI agent butler for macOS and Windows** (with Chrome and VS Code extensions). It watches over the AI coding agents you already run — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf, OpenClaw, and Aider — and handles the parts that quietly cost you money:

- It **compresses every prompt 40–70%** before it hits the API, with meaning preserved.
- It **monitors each agent live** — tokens, cost, cache efficiency, burn rate, context-window fill.
- It **stops runaway agents** with a budget circuit breaker that pauses or kills the process before the next API call.
- It **manages your MCP servers** — discovering, risk-scoring, and toggling them without editing JSON.
- It **diagnoses waste** with 25 one-click Doctor scans (cache thrash, duplicate tool calls, redundant reads, context burn).

Everything runs locally. Your prompts and sessions never leave your machine.

## Supported agents

Terse auto-detects and monitors **8 coding agents** — no setup:

**Claude Code** · **Cursor** · **OpenAI Codex** · **GitHub Copilot CLI** · **Cline** · **Windsurf** · **OpenClaw** · **Aider**

For Claude Code it goes deepest: exact token counts, cache read/write efficiency, live JSONL session streaming, and 30 days of historical backfill.

## Three optimization modes

Terse never mangles code, file paths, or technical terms — code blocks are always protected.

- **Soft** — typo correction + whitespace only. 100% meaning-safe.
- **Normal** — removes filler, hedging, politeness padding, meta-language; shortens phrases.
- **Aggressive** — maximum compression: abbreviations, article removal, telegraph style.

Grounded in real research — [LLMLingua](https://www.terseai.org/llmlingua), Norvig spelling, and selective-context pruning. See the [technique deep-dives](https://www.terseai.org/telegraph-compression).
